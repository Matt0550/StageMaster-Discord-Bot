# StageMaster

**StageMaster is a discord bot** created to change the way servers work, instead of having permanent channels you can now create temporary ones that delete themselves once they are empty.

The original code was taken from the [VoiceMaster bot](https://github.com/SamSanai/VoiceMaster-Discord-Bot) and adapted to my needs.

_The bot is programmed via [**discord.py**](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)_

# How to configure the bot:

1. Download python using the following link:

- [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone the bot from GitHub

3. Open the terminal and follow these steps:

- Change directory to this folder and type:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Open `bot.py` in a text editor and replace `"Insert Discord token here"` with your token bot

5. Run the bot
# Usage
For setup bot use `.stage setup` command

For the command list use `.help` command
